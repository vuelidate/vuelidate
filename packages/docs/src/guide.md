# Guide

## Basics

As we mentioned in the [getting started guide](/#getting-started-2), validation rules are defined inside the object returned by the `validations`
method. We will refer to those as just _validations_ from now on.

You can access the component's instance, and its properties via `this` when writing more complicated validation rules.

::: warning
**Note:** Pre Vuelidate 2 `validations` was allowed to be an object as well as a function. This is still available, for backwards compatibility
reasons, but is discouraged. Please migrate to a method instead.
:::

Each validation rule must have a corresponding property inside the `data` object.

```html

<script>
import { useVuelidate } from '@vuelidate/core'
import { required } from '@vuelidate/validators'

export default {
  setup () {
    return {
      v$: useVuelidate()
    }
  },
  data () {
    return {
      name: ''
    }
  },
  validations () {
    return {
      name: { required }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

Vuelidate comes with a set of validators, that live inside the `@vuelidate/validations` package, which you must install separately. For a full list of
available validators, check the [Validators](./validators.md) page.

Validators are functions that receive the matching value and return either a `boolean` or an object with a `$valid` property. If the validation
passes, return `true` or `{ $valid: true }`, `false` otherwise.

The built-in validators are additionally wrapped in an object which contains several additional properties like:

* `$validator` – contains the validation function
* `$message` – contains the validator’s error message
* `$params` – contains the params that are passed during validator configuration (applies to validators that accept configuration)

Here’s an example of how the `minLength` validator looks like:

```js
export default function minLength (min) {
  return {
    $validator: minLength(min),
    $message: ({ $params }) => `This field should be at least ${$params.min} long.`,
    $params: { min }
  }
}
```

Vuelidate also supports writing your own custom validators, you can learn more about how to write your own validators on
the [Custom Validators](./custom_validators.md) page.

## Checking for validation state

Now that we have our validation rules set up, we can start checking for errors.

Vuelidate builds a validation state, that can be accessed via the exposed Vuelidate property (this is the property name that you return from `setup`),
most commonly called `v$` or just `v`. It is a nested object that follows your `validations` structure, but with some extra validity related
properties.

`v$` is also reactive - meaning it changes as the user interacts with the state!

Building up on our form example above, to check whether name is valid we can now check to see if the `name.$error` property is `true` or `false`, and
display an error for our users.

```html
<label>
  <input v-model="name">
  <div v-if="v$.name.$error">Name field has an error.</div>
</label>
```

Using this approach, you can apply error classes, show messages or add attributes.

The properties you will check against most often are:

```
  "$dirty": false,
  "$error": false,
  "$errors": [],
  "$silentErrors": [],
  "$invalid": false,
```

This is just a subset of all the properties, but they are enough to get us started. To see all available properties, check
the [Validation state API](./api/state.md)

## The dirty state

Vuelidate tracks the `$dirty` state of each property. This is used to keep fields from showing as invalid, before the user has interacted with them.

A property is considered `$dirty` after it has received some sort of interaction from the user, which means all properties begin with a `$dirty` state
of `false`.

There are two properties, attached to each validation field, that are used to check if said field is valid, `$invalid` and `$error`.

Although the validations will run in the background updating the `$invalid` state, the `$error` will stay `false` until both the `$dirty`
and `$invalid` states are `true`.

There are multiple ways to update the `$dirty` state.

### Using `$touch`

You can programmatically update the `$dirty` state by calling the `$touch` method on a validation field. For example, for the `name` field you can
call `v$.name.$touch()` to change its `$dirty` state.

Here’s an example of adding it to the above form, where we attach it to the `@blur` event so that our error only shows up after the user entered and
left the input.

```html
<label>
  <input v-model="name" @blur="v$.name.$touch">
  <div v-if="v$.name.$error">Name field has an error.</div>
</label>
```

If you want to change the `$dirty` state for more than one property, you can also use `v$.$touch()`, which will call `$touch` on all the nested
properties. `$touch` is attached to each field, to its parent, all the way up to the root of the validation.

This is useful in cases where you have a **Submit** button and want to trigger the whole form `$dirty`.
See [Validating Forms Before Submitting](./guide#validating-forms-before-submitting) for an example.

### Using the `$model` property

Another way to ensure that the `$dirty` state is updated when a user interacts with an input, is to directly bind your input's `v-model` declaration
to the `$model` of that field's validation object.

This is a special property that acts as a "proxy" to the targeted property. When you modify it, it calls `$touch()` for that property and then
proceeds to update the original value.

```html

<template>
  <input v-model="v$.name.$model">
</template>

<script>
import { useVuelidate } from '@vuelidate/core'
import { required } from '@vuelidate/validators'

export default {
  setup: () => ({ v$: useVuelidate() })
  data () {
    return {
      name: ''
    }
  },
  validations () {
    return {
      name: { required }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

This binding is accomplished internally through a getter/setter that reads and updates the original state. When the setter is called, it also
triggers `$touch()` for that property.

### Setting dirty state with `$autoDirty`

It is quite common to forget to use `$model` or `$touch`. If you want to ensure dirty state is always tracked, you can use the `$autoDirty` config
param, when defining your validation rules.

```js
import { useVuelidate } from '@vuelidate/core'
import { required } from '@vuelidate/validators'

export default {
  setup: () => ({ v$: useVuelidate() }),
  data () {
    return { name: '' }
  },
  validations () {
    return {
      name: { required, $autoDirty: true },
    }
  }
}
```

This will create an internal watcher, that will update `$dirty`, the moment that field property is changed. It will ensure the validator tracks its
bound data, and sets the dirty state accordingly.

You can then change your field's `v-model` expression to just the data property:

```html
<input v-model="name">
```

:::tip You can pass `$autoDirty` to all validators, by defining it in the global config
- [Providing global config to your Vuelidate instance](./advanced_usage.md#providing-global-config-to-your-vuelidate-instance)
:::

### Lazy validations

Validation in Vuelidate 2 introduces the `$lazy` param, which will make the selected validators lazy. That means they will only be called, after the
field is `$dirty`, so after `touch()` is called, by using that property’s `$model` or by also using the `$autoDirty` param.

This saves extra invocations for async validators as well as makes the initial validation setup a bit more performant.

```js
import { useVuelidate } from '@vuelidate/core'
import { required } from '@vuelidate/validators'

export default {
  setup: () => ({ v$: useVuelidate() }),
  data () {
    return { name: '' }
  },
  validations () {
    return {
      name: { required, $lazy: true },
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip You can pass `$lazy` to all validators, by defining it in the global config
- [Providing global config to your Vuelidate instance](./advanced_usage.md#providing-global-config-to-your-vuelidate-instance)
:::

### Resetting dirty state

If you wish to reset a form's `$dirty` state, you can do so by using the appropriately named `$reset` method. For example when closing a create/edit
modal, you don't want the validation state to persist.

```html

<app-modal @closed="v$.$reset()">
  <!-- some inputs  -->
</app-modal>
```

## Collective properties

The validation state has entries for each validator, that hold a set of helpful properties that we can use to show warnings, add classes and more.

```json
{
  "$dirty": false,
  "$error": false,
  "$errors": [],
  "$silentErrors": [],
  "$invalid": false,
  // ...other properties
  "name": {
    "$dirty": false,
    "required": {
      "$message": "Value is required",
      "$params": {},
      "$pending": false,
      "$invalid": false
    },
    "$invalid": false,
    "$pending": false,
    "$error": false,
    "$errors": [],
    "$silentErrors": []
    // ...other properties
  }
}
```

As you can see, the `name` field has its own `$dirty`, `$error` among other attributes, as well as an object for the `required` validator.

The root properties like, `$dirty`, `$error` and `$invalid` are all collective computed properties, meaning their value changes depending on the
nested children's state.

**Example:** If a form has 10 fields and one of them has its `$error: true`, then the root `$error` will also be `true`, giving additional
flexibility when trying to display error state.

## Displaying error messages

::: tip
All validators in Vuelidate 2 include error messages.
:::

The validation state holds useful data, like the invalid state of each property validator, along with extra properties, like an error message or extra
parameters.

Error messages come out of the box with the bundled validators in `@vuelidate/validators` package. You can see how to customise error messages at
the [Custom Validators page](./custom_validators.md)

The easiest way to display errors is to use the form's top level `$errors` property. It is an array of validation objects, that you can iterate over.
Use the `$uid` property for your `key`.

```vue
<p
  v-for="error of v$.$errors"
  :key="error.$uid"
>
<strong>{{ error.$validator }}</strong>
<small> on property</small>
<strong>{{ error.$property }}</strong>
<small> says:</small>
<strong>{{ error.$message }}</strong>
</p>
```

You can also check for errors on each form property:

```vue
<p
  v-for="error of v$.name.$errors"
  :key="error.$uid"
>
<!-- Same as above -->
</p>
```

## Validating forms before submitting

To submit a form, you often need to validate it first. It is a good practice to call the `$validate` method on the form first, so all validators (including those
with `$lazy: true`) are run. This will also cause all the errors to show up that were hidden due to `$dirty` state being `false`.

It returns a promise, which resolves with a boolean when all validators resolve, depending on the validation status.

```js
export default {
  methods: {
    async submitForm () {
      const isFormCorrect = await this.v$.$validate()
      // you can show some extra alert to the user or just leave the each field to show its `$errors`.
      if (!isFormCorrect) return
      // actually submit form
    }
  }
}
```
