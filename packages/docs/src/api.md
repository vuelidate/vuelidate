# API

There are two distinct structures present in _vuelidate_:

* `validations` component option - the definition of your validation
* `$v structure` - an object in your viewmodel that holds the validation state

## Validation State Values

`$v` model represents the current state of validation. It does so by defining a set of properties which hold the output of user defined validation functions, following the `validations` option structure.
The presence of those special reserved keywords means that you cannot specify your own validators with that name.

| Name        | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$invalid`  | **boolean** | Indicates the state of validation for given model becomes `true` when any of it's child validators specified in options returns a **falsy** value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `$dirty`    | **boolean** | A flag representing if the field under validation was touched by the user at least once. Usually it is used to decide if the message is supposed to be displayed to the end user. You can manage this flag manually by using **$touch** and `$reset` methods. It is set automatically when writing to `$model` value. The `$dirty` flag is considered true if given model was `$touched` or **all of it's children** are `$dirty`.                                                        |
| `$anyDirty` | **boolean** | A flag very similar to `$dirty`, with one exception. The `$anyDirty` flag is considered `true` if given model was `$touched` or **any of it's children** are `$anyDirty` which means at least one descenant is `$dirty`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `$model`    | **any**     | A reference to the original validated model. Reading this value will always give you exactly the same value as if you referenced the model directly. That means `this.$v.value.$model` is equivalent to `this.value` when read. Writing to that value will update the model and invoke `$touch` method automatically. This is very useful to use as `v-model` payload, providing a way of automatically marking given field as `$dirty` on first touch. Pairs well with `.lazy` modifier. |
| `$error`    | **boolean** | Convenience flag to easily decide if a message should be displayed. Equivalent to `this.$dirty && !this.$pending && this.$invalid`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `$errors`   | **Array**   | Collection of all the error messages, collected for all child properties and nested forms (Vue components). Only contains errors from properties where `$dirty` equals `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `$silentErrors`   | **Array**   | Collection of all the error messages, collected for all child properties and nested forms (Vue components).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `$anyError` | **boolean** | Convenience flag to easily decide if a message should be displayed. A variant that considers error to be displayed when itself or **at least one** of its children has `$error` equal to `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `$pending`  | **boolean** | Indicates if any child async validator is currently pending. Always `false` if all validators are synchronous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `$params`   | **object**  | Contains types and parameters of all provided validators at the current level, as well as types and parameters of child validation groups, which may be declared using `withParams`. Useful as an input to your error rendering system. Safe to use in translated text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Validation methods

| Name                  | Type         | Description                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$validate`           | **function** | Triggers all validators if not triggered already. Returns a Promise with a boolean, which resolves once all validators finish. |
| `$touch`              | **function** | Sets its property and all nested properties `$dirty` state to true.                                                            |
| `$getResultsForChild` | **function** | Retrieves the validation results for a nested form component.                                                                  |
| `$reset`              | **function** | Resets the validation state of a validation tree.                                                                              |
